Test-CheckManifest
==================

The MANIFEST file is one critical point of each module on CPAN. Many programmers
(including myself) add new testscripts or new files to the distribution. But then
these files are not added to the MANIFEST.

This can cause problems during installation process.

This module aims to help the programmer to keep the MANIFEST file up to date.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
